# Javascript code samples

This repo has been created solely for the purpose of review by companies with dev roles requiring elements of javascript,
as much of my code is not in the public domain. All of the JS sample code is in the one file
[javascriptCodeSamples.js](https://github.com/derekdon/javascript-code-samples/blob/master/javascriptCodeSamples.js)
for simplicity sake. Unit tests for this file are located in
[javascriptCodeSamples.Spec.js](https://github.com/derekdon/javascript-code-samples/blob/master/test/unit/javascriptCodeSamples.Spec.js).

I will add another repo separately to demonstrate my coding of a SPA using AngularJs etc.

### Other language code samples hosted publicly on GitHub

*Please note I need to upload some more recent code samples as these are quite old, including some Dart, Android/Java, Scala etc.*
