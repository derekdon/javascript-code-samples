# Javascript code samples

This repo has been created solely for the purpose of review by companies with dev roles requiring elements of javascript, as much of my code is not in the public domain. All of the JS sample code is in the one file [javascript-code-samples.js](https://github.com/derekdon/javascript-code-samples/blob/master/javascript-code-samples.js) for simplicity sake. I will add another repo separately to demonstrate the coding of a SPA using AngularJs etc.

*TODO: Add some unit tests to cover the utility methods.*

### Other language code samples hosted publicly on GitHub

*Please note I need to upload some more recent code samples as these are quite old.*
